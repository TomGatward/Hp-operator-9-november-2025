## Overview


Prime-anchored Hilbert-Polya approach: Abel-regularized trace, Stieltjes resolvent, and a tau-determinant identity for the Riemann xi-function. 


## Abstract


We develop a prime–anchored Hilbert–Pólya framework and prove a determinant identity that matches the zeros of the completed zeta function with those of a $\tau$–determinant built purely from primes. We define a prime–anchored trace $\tau$ on the even Paley–Wiener cone via the explicit formula with Abel–regularized resolvent and an explicit archimedean subtraction; no operator is assumed at this stage. From the Abel–regularized Poisson semigroup $\Theta(t)$ we obtain a unique positive measure $\mu$ by Bernstein’s theorem and realize the canonical arithmetic Hilbert–Pólya operator $A_\tau$ as multiplication by $\lambda$ on $L^2((0,\infty),\mu)$. For $\Re s>0$ the resolvent trace
\[
\mathcal T(s):=\tau\!\big((A_\tau^2+s^2)^{-1}\big)=\int_{(0,\infty)}\frac{d\mu(\lambda)}{\lambda^2+s^2}
\]
is holomorphic and admits meromorphic continuation to $\C$ with no branch cut on $i\R$; this forces $\mu$ to be purely atomic. An Abel boundary identity on the real axis gives
\[
\frac{\Xi'}{\Xi}(a)=2a\,\mathcal T(a)+H'(a)\qquad(a>0),
\]
and analytic continuation yields the global identity
\[
\Xi(s)=C\,e^{H(s)}\,\det\nolimits_{\tau}\!\big(A_\tau^2+s^2\big),
\]
with $\dfrac{d}{ds}\log\det_\tau(A_\tau^2+s^2)=2s\,\mathcal T(s)$ and $C=\Xi(0)e^{-H(0)}$. Consequently, the zeros of $\Xi$ are exactly $\{\pm i\gamma\}$ with multiplicities $m_\gamma=2i\gamma\,\Res_{s=i\gamma}\mathcal T(s)$. The argument is non–circular: the zero side is used only to certify complete monotonicity (or positivity on a Fejér/log positive–definite cone), not to input locations, and the archimedean subtraction is needed only on the real axis.
